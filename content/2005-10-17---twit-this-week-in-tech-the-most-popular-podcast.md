I’m enjoying listening to these fun hour long discussions from Leo Laporte’s gang on anything tech related. Currently they’re doing it just for the love of it, but with a quarter of a million listeners and a growing fan-base will they sell out and go commercial? They don’t think so.

You can subscribe to the TWiT podcast through [iTunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itunes), or download the podcast MP3′s directly from [the TWiT website](https://thisweekintech.com/).

You can also download these as large (approx 500Mb) movie files using [bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittorrent) from [Revision3](https://revision3.com/twit).

[Azureus](https://azureus.sourceforge.net/) is currently my favorite bittorrent client.
