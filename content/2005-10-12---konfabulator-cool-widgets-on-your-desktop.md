[Konfabulator](https://www.konfabulator.com/info)  
  
 has lots of interesting things you can use on your desktop, or on a separate screen that fades in and out over your desktop.  
  
Weather reports, tv guides, a nice little picture frame with your pictures in. It’spretty much identical MaxOSX’s [Dashboard](https://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/), but this one is cross platform, so runs on Windows or MacOSX.  
  
Yahoo resently bought the company, and are looking to have widgets related to your YahooID, so you can have the same desktop features on any computer when you log into your Yahoo account. They promised to keep it free when they bought it.

Here’s a screenshot of Apple’s [Dashboard](https://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/) for MaxOSX Tiger to give you an idea.
