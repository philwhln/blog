[AOL to Add Free Phone to Instant Messaging Feature – New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/05/technology/05phone.html)

This is a great idea. Quite an investment for AOL, but is definately a way to catch up with Skype. The main problem I have with AOL Instant Messenger at the moment is how ugly it is. I like the fact it can do video chat with Apple’s iChat, but the picture is so small. Skype is still not so pretty, and the interface is a bit clunky, and video chat is being developed slowly, currently only available on certain versions of Windows XP. Even Apple’s iChat interface is pretty confusing for first time users – so many windows can pop up and remain all over the screen is you repeatedly attempt calling the same person.
