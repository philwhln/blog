[Digg.com](https://digg.com/) is a great tech news feed, that seems to be becoming more popular than the infamous [Slashdot.org](https://www.slashdot.org). I discovered this when listening to [TWiT podcast](https://thisweekintech.com/).  
  
Itâ€™s full of good news stories and great feedback and debate by the users of this service.  
  
Can you digg it?
