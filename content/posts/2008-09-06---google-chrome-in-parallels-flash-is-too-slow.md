I use Windows on my iMac using Parallels and Firefox runs very well. There’s not really anything I cannot do, since it is actually the fasted experience of Windows I’ve ever had. This is mainly due to using Macs and having not needed Windows for a long time, whilst the speed to computers and virtualization progressed.

Youtube is fine on Firefox in Parallels. I have not noticed any problems with running Flash in general. When Google Chrome came out this week I was desperate to test it out. Since it is currently only available on Windows, I fired up Parallels and installed it. I really wanted to see how much faster JavaScript was and how the experience compared in general.

One of the first places I went was YouTube. I was astonished by the fact that video just would not play. There is soooo much lag that it’s the equivalent of watching a slide with really bad choppy sound. What is going on here? I started up Firefox in Parallels to check, and everything was fine.

Is anyone else seeing these major performance problems with Flash in Google Chrome?

        <p>Hi Ramirek,<br />I’ve been steering clear of Vista myself as it’s been a headache helping friends out who have it.<br />Are you running Parallels?<br />My advice who be making sure you have the latest and greatest version of Flash installed. If in doubt install the one for Vista from Adobe’s website.<br />Cheers,<br />Phil</p>

        <p>The buggy flash is a known problem. Google just released an update. Probably fixed it. I read something about flash video bug fixes in the changelog.</p>
