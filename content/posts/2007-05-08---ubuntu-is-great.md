Ok, so I just updated to the latest version of Ubuntu – “Feisty Fawn”. Couldn’t notice a whole lot of difference on my work machine, and the effects didn’t work. But on my laptop it seems much much faster and that’s with the wobbly windows and other effects running full whack.

The update process wasn’t so smooth. This was because at work we had the full CD and not the alternate CD, and I was trying to be clever. At home I didn’t have any CDs but had downloaded the ISO image of the alternate CD and mounted that as if it was an actual CD. The command line upgrade didnt seem to work too well. I may have been doing it wrong. I recommend doing it through the System-&gt;Administration-&gt;UpdateManager and letting it download overnight, for an easy life.

Lately I noticed Firefox crashing a lot on Ubuntu. I don’t think this is because of the Feisty upgrade though. Hopefully it’s a minor issues that just needs finding and fixing.

VLC on my laptop needs sorting out as I cannot see any videos, and DVDs won’t play at all. I think it may be due to hacking the previous version too much to get things going.

But, overall Ubuntu is starting to look great. Am looking forward to the next release.
