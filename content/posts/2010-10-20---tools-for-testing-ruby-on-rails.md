I’m getting stuck into learning Ruby On Rails and the topic of which tools / frameworks to use for testing came up. Here’s some notes. I’ll be reading up on these testing frameworks in the following order. If you’ve got an thoughts, comments or other ideas, please let me know in the comments.

__Test::Unit__

*   Vanilla unit tests

__rspec__

*   TDD (test-driven development), old-skool, very popular

__Factorygirl__

*   replaces fixtures and test data

__Shoulda__

*   automating test creation with syntactic shortcuts

__Cucumber__

*   BDD (behaviour-driven development) tests written in English-ish

_Components of Cucumber_

__webrat__

*   Tests full stack

__capybara__

*   Drop-in replacement for webrat within Cucumber
*   Nicer JavaScript testing than webrat
*   Web front-end testing using Selenium

_Some other cool testing tools_

__specjour__

*   Distribute test runs across multiple machine using Bonjour

__cijoe__

*   A continuous integration server
