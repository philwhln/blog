If you’re looking for a replacement for Microsoft Office on the Mac then this seems to be the best (if not the only) option.  
  
Just loaded it up for the first time on my Mac-Mini and seems to run pretty sweet. Seems even better than the original OpenOffice on Windows, but that could just be because everything does on the Mac.  
  
Who would have thought that a couple of months ago I’d never even used a Mac
