I think everyone should get one of these. I think it’s the future!  
  
It’s the size of a book, silent, easy to use and looks great. Also you don’t need to install virus protection and the firewall is built in. In fact pretty much everything I needed already was built in. It’s not the most powerful thing, but if you’ve had trouble with windows and just looking for a simple computer that can do everything you need to do, then this is the one.
